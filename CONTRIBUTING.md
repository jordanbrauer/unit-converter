### Style Guide

* Files **MUST** use only `<?php` tags.
* Files **MUST** use only `utf-8` encoding without BOM.
* Files **MUST** use LF (Unix) line endings.
* Files **MUST** end with an empty line.
* Files SHOULD either declare symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.) _or_ cause side-effects (e.g. generate output, change .ini settings, etc.) but SHOULD NOT do both.
* Namespaces and classes **MUST** follow the "autoloading" PSR standard, [PSR-4]().
* Class names **MUST** be declared in `StudlyCaps`.
* Class constants **MUST** be declared in all upper case with underscore separators.
* Class method and property names **MUST** be declared in `camelCase`.

### Writing Tests

In an effort to keep an easily maintainable code base for everyone, I ask that any contributions you end up making include the appropriate tests that affirm the integrity of your code.

### Submitting a Pull Request

When it comes time for submission, make sure that you target the `master` branch of this repository.
